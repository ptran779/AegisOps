    complete rewrite of the AI infastructure
    
    now operate based on sensor->decision->atomic behavior
    migrate complete for base atomic behavior + sensor
    complete new API build from scratch for deep RRN model
    
    AI model:
    inference is now complete and CPU friendly (sorta as long as it stay on a seperate thread)
    
    need to work on error & back propagation
    
    need a training model
    
    Agent AI
    not ready: only being use to test for simple stuff rn, has not been hook up with the rnn yet.
    
    need a training way: 1 with synthesis data and live training config
    
    Render
    redesign rendering system, now support mid animation transmutation between 2 speperate animation obj (as long as they have same bone)

    Minor Fixes
    Fixed occasional null targeting causing goal glitches.
    
    Core re-organization
    Reorganized goal system: Targeting goal now manages target dropping to avoid premature target loss caused by attack goal stopping early (thanks, Minecraft modding quirks).
    
    New Skills
    Soldier – Hype: Added battle flow effect with a slight attack speed boost (balancing tweaks coming later).
    
    New Demolition Skills & Items
    Grenade: New throwable item with TNT-level explosion power that does no block damage.
    Triggers only when demolition detects a configurable cluster of enemies (default: 3 enemies within 3 blocks of the main target).
    
    Vector Pursuer: Kamikaze drone with pathfinding that targets high-value enemies (default: targets with at least 30 health). Upon detecting a valid target within range, it deploys the drone entity.
    
    Vector Drone Entity Behavior
    If target alive and beyond 12 blocks: pathfind to target.
    
    Within 12 blocks: enter killer mode — speed up and charge the enemy for kamikaze detonation.
    
    If target dies or becomes null mid-flight: drone returns to deployer and drops as an item (no wasted drones).
    
    New Feature
    Agents now auto-pickup nearby items.
    (May cause lag if many items cluster near an agent — will monitor and optimize as needed.

    New drop pod variance: Hell Pod 
     - one land, penetrate the ground, then lift the entity up
     - Replace the default dropped. The default drop pod will be repurposed for something else later
    
    New Item: Modular Shield
    
     - 600 durability
    
     - use for Heavy special
    
    New special Skill: Heavy Shield Bash.
     - When equipped with a modular shield, Heavy performs shield bash:
    phase 1: equip
    
    phase 2: Charge toward the enemy until 3 3-block radius
    
    phase 3: taunt: Target entity will target heavy, and all enemies within 8 8-block radius WITH a target redirect agro toward Heavy 
    
    phase 4: Shield Bash: all enemy within 3 block radius in front get a knockback + 4 dmg
    
    -- if heavy has no gun, recover and end
    
    -- if heavy has a gun, try to shot target 3 time and end
    
    Minor bug fix:

    add medic goal
    redo attack goal: stop will not drop target. This allow special goal to trigger without loosing target
    add sniper goal
    
    add 2 medic items
    
    fix #1 cause by incorrect config value. Additional check added to trigger regenerate default config.
    minor bug fix on attack goal. As I forgot to calcute the distance between target and user.

    - update default texture to fix a few spot here and there
    - rework animation. Now Agent will have their own living animation
    - implement timeframe handler for pose animation
    
    - update path finding: now throttle at 10 tick before calling pathfind (may not help much in term of tps? but why not)
    
    Finish structure: double barrel turret and portable dispenser. Work on by engieer
    Apply structure animation
